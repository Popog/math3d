This is a linear algebra library for the Go programming language (http://golang.org)
It is intended for use with OpenGl. It only implements fixed size vectors and matrixes. 

This library comes in two flavours: math3d/math3d64 using float64 and math3d/math3d32 using float32.

Note that this code uses row major matrixes.
